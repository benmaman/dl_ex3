 if you search for tenderness & it isn't hard to find & you can have the love you need to live & but if you look for truthfulness & you might just as well be blind & it always seems to be so hard to give & honesty is such a lonely word & everyone is so untrue & honesty is hardly ever heard & and mostly what i need from you & i can always find someone & to say they sympathize & if i wear my heart out on my sleeve & but i don't want some pretty face & to tell me pretty lies & all i want is someone to believe & honesty is such a lonely word & everyone is so untrue & honesty is hardly ever heard & and mostly what i need from you & i can find a lover & i can find a friend & i can have security until the bitter end & anyone can comfort me & with promises again & i know i know & when i'm deep inside of me & don't be too concerned & i won't ask for nothin' while i'm gone & but when i want sincerity & tell me where else can i turn & 'cause you're the one i depend upon & honesty is such a lonely word & everyone is so untrue & honesty is hardly ever heard & and mostly what i need from you &
